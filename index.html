              <p>Hi, I am Shreya Mohan and I have completed my BE in Computer sCience from Sri Siddhartha Institute of technology,Tumkur.
                  I'm a hardworking individual who would like to learn and posess new skills. My hobbies are singing, listening to music and reading books.
                  I possess skills in various technologies which I have listed in the below section.

            <h1 class="headings">Machine learning</h1>
            <p>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through
                experience and by the use of data.
                It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
                The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
                The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.
                Also the synonym self-teaching computers was used in this time period.
                Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. 
                The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
                For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data.
                If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. 
                But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.
                Modern day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.
                Where as, a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.</p>

                <p>Java is a high-level,class-based,It is a object-oriented programming language that is designed
                    to have as few implementation dependenciesas possible.It is a general-purpose programming
                    language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere[WORA],meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
                    A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be
                    related to each other;these relations help structure the data.SQL is a language programmers use
                    to create,modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the
                    database.</p>
